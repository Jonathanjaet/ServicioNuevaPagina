      <h1>WELCOME!</h1>
      <p>The 1st International Conference on EMPOWER Women in MOFs and Beyond is aimed to
        enhance the visibility and recognition of the contributions of female scientist in the field of
        Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) and similar porous hybrid materials, encouraging women
        to pursue their interests in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and a
        career in academia.
        The ambition of the conference is to unify women in science: undergraduate students,
        postgraduate students, PhD students, postdoctoral researchers and established researchers,
        giving all participants the tools to establish an engaging and close-knit community of
        mentorship for young scientists gaining female role models in their own field and promoting
        women’s sense of belonging in STEM and academia.
        The source of inspiration of this first topical conference within this field arises from the main
        goal of promoting women researching within the field of MOFs and similar materials, striving
        to be a turning point in the history of this field. For this reason, all talks will be presented by
        women, thus promoting the broad visibility of their work. The audience will be of mixed
        gender, encouraging diversity in an inclusive forum for scientific discussions. Conference
        activities will include networking, scientific workshops and round-tables, supporting active
        communication. Additionally, the conference will host activities related to spreading
        awareness regarding gender equity and equality, with the aim of working toward a more
        diverse environment within the STEM fields.
        The mail goal of this conference is to promote women researching within the field of MOFs
        and similar porous hybrid materials, to unify the scientific community and to raise awareness
        of the need of gender equity and equality in the sciences.
        The conference wishes to promote an inclusive forum in which all participants of all genders
        are welcome. Overcoming gender inequality requires an ongoing open dialogue between all
        researchers of all genders, coupled to dedicated efforts in counteracting gender bias in the
        broader community.
        Although the term “women” is used in the context of this conference, we invite and welcome
        all attendees who identify as women, transgender, agender, genderqueer, non-binary, and
        Two-Spirit.</p>

      <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
      <p>While gender parity in the scientific community has experienced some improvement over the
        last several decades, women still constitute a minority in science with 33.3% of the world’s
        researchers being women in 2018, according to the UNESCO Science Report (UNESCO, 2021).
        The consensus among the participating countries in the UNESCO STEM and Gender
        Advancement (SAGA) project is that there is an decreasing proportion of female researchers
        with increasing advancement to more senior career levels (UNESCO, 2021). Some examples of
        yet remaining issues, presented in the UNESCO Science Report, are economic inequalities,
        lower representation of women’s contributions in high-profile journals, lower citation levels of
        female-authored publications, funding disparities, and tougher standards for women in tenure
        evaluations, job applications and in the peer-review process (UNESCO, 2021). Women are also
        less often given plenary and key note presentations than men, thus reducing their visibility and
        recognition of their work (UNESCO, 2021).
        Overcoming the mentioned persistent challenges requires an ongoing open dialogue between
        all researchers, coupled to dedicated efforts that promote the scientific contributions of female
        researchers, building strong mentorship networks among female researchers and trainees, and
        actively counteracting gender bias in science. There is a growing global awareness of the
        benefits of gender parity, as well as having a diverse workforce, in terms of work efficiency and
        economic prosperity, and is considered an important element in tackling the imminent future
        challenges our planet and society face including Climate Change and its social, economic and
        environmental consequences, global health and future pandemics as well as enabling a
        positive transformation in the ongoing digital revolution (UNESCO, 2021).
        The aim of this conference is to enhance the visibility and recognition of the contributions of
        female scientist in the field of Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) and similar porous hybrid
        materials, encouraging women to pursue their interests in science, technology, engineering
        and mathematics (STEM) and a career in academia by establishing a community of
        mentorship for young scientists gaining female role models in their own field and promoting
        women’s sense of belonging in STEM and academia. In addition, we also would like to
        emphasize the need of raising the awareness for all kinds of challenges women scientists
        face daily in academia, reporting from the broader community of the unsolved issues to the
        resulting consequences of the gender inequality in our society.</p>

      <h1>PROGRAM</h1>
      <p>With the aim of reaching a larger audience and participation, both nationally within Mexico
        and internationally, the conference is held at two locations in Mexico: Mexico City, the
        epicenter for the MOF community in Mexico and, Merida, a hub for Mexican culture, history,
        and nature. The two parts of the conference will have distinct agendas within the scope of
        the conference and options for participants to participate in both or one of the two sections.
        The Young Researchers Symposium in Mexico City will be focused on young women within
        the area of MOFs, COFs and similar materials will be the first “ice-breaker scenario”, with the
        goal to promote interaction, collaboration, networking, as well as mentoring, establishing a
        unified community of women in the area. The second part of the conference has been
        designed to engage participants in workshops and poster sessions in an informal and
        welcoming atmosphere, in the city of Merida, on the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico.</p>
